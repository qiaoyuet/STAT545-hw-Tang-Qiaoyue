## To-Dos

- [x] Fix indentation problem
- [x] Change picture size

## How the changes are done
I created this repo in GitHub and cloned it locally then linked it to a R-project. All the changes are done in R-studio and reflected into GitHub through save-pull-commit-push commands. Pictures were added locally to the project folder and pushed into GitHub. I looked up in the posted sample readme file and its raw source to try out functionalities including headings, pictures, links, to-dos and bullet points. I changed picture size using another syntax found online.

The R Markdown documents worked well. I created the Rmarkdown file in R-studio then editted from there. The code and words are added locally from R-studio and then knitted and pushed up to GitHub. I found it not too difficult if following the instructions on the homepage.
