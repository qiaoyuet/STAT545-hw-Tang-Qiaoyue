### Task 1: Get the maximum and minimum of GDP per capita for all continents.

``` r
gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>% 
  summarize(max_gdp=max(gdpPercap), min_gdp=min(gdpPercap)) %>% 
  mutate(diff=max_gdp-min_gdp)
```

    ## # A tibble: 5 x 4
    ##   continent   max_gdp    min_gdp      diff
    ##      <fctr>     <dbl>      <dbl>     <dbl>
    ## 1    Africa  21951.21   241.1659  21710.05
    ## 2  Americas  42951.65  1201.6372  41750.02
    ## 3      Asia 113523.13   331.0000 113192.13
    ## 4    Europe  49357.19   973.5332  48383.66
    ## 5   Oceania  34435.37 10039.5956  24395.77

From the table we can see that the maximun of GDP per Capita over all appears in Asia, and the minimum appears in Africa. I've also included a difference column which tells the difference between the maximum GDP and the minimum GDP. We can see that the largest gap occurs in Asia.

One problem that I hope to solve is to make min\_gdp also with 2 digits of decimals, but since summarize does not have an argument that sets decimal places.

### Task 2: Look at the spread of GDP per capita within the continents.

``` r
gapminder %>%
  select(gdpPercap, continent) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=continent, y=gdpPercap)) + 
              geom_point(alpha=0.5) + 
              geom_boxplot() +
              ggtitle("Boxplot of GDP per Capital Across Continents") +
              theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
              labs(x="Continent", y="GDP per Capita")
```

![](hw03_files/figure-markdown_github-ascii_identifiers/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png) From the boxplot we can see that Asia has the largest variation of GDP per Capita. Even though the middle 50% data are not as variable as Europe, it has a lot more extreme values than the other continents. Oceania seems to have the smallest varaition.

One interesting issue: when I put labs() after theme(), the title alignment is not adjusted. Not sure why this is the case.

### Task 3: Compute a trimmed mean of life expectancy for different years.

``` r
dat1 <- gapminder %>%
  select(country, lifeExp, year) %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarise(weighted_lifeExp = weighted.mean(lifeExp, c(1:12)/78))

dat2 <- gapminder %>%
  select(country, lifeExp, year) %>% 
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarize(mean(lifeExp))

inner_join(dat1, dat2, by="country")
```

    ## # A tibble: 142 x 3
    ##        country weighted_lifeExp `mean(lifeExp)`
    ##         <fctr>            <dbl>           <dbl>
    ##  1 Afghanistan         40.00268        37.47883
    ##  2     Albania         71.50085        68.43292
    ##  3     Algeria         64.24856        59.03017
    ##  4      Angola         39.80245        37.88350
    ##  5   Argentina         71.18441        69.06042
    ##  6   Australia         76.75038        74.66292
    ##  7     Austria         75.32151        73.10325
    ##  8     Bahrain         69.89115        65.60567
    ##  9  Bangladesh         54.40028        49.83408
    ## 10     Belgium         75.55836        73.64175
    ## # ... with 132 more rows

dat1 provides the trimmed life expectancy and dat2 provides the ordinary mean of life expectancy. I joined them together in one table using inner\_join. The trimmed mean weights are assigned as 1/sum(1:12), 2/sum(1:12), etc. which puts larger weight on later years and smaller weight on previous years. It would make sense in the case where we believe data collection process are getting more precise, so we want the most accurate data to reflect the true mean.
