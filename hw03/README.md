## Describe Process of hw03

I have included several questions that I wish to solve later (or get help from TAs) in the md file along with the graphs. Overall, I found that sometimes it's easier to show a table like in task 1 and sometimes it's easier to only show the graphs like in task 4. I think I'm getting more farmiliar with ggplot and dplyr, but I would like to learn more functionalities in the following classes. The resources that I found useful is [R-blogger](https://www.r-bloggers.com/). They have very detailed tutorials and many examples.
