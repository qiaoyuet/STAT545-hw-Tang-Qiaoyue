# HW02

## Description

In this homework we further explores the gapminder dataset including exploring single variables and multiple variables. ggplot is used to help visualize the dataset. There are also some additional question about dplyr and making decent tables.

## Describe Process of hw02

- The major difficulties appear to be what graphs do I want to show. Since gapminder includes so many information, it is quite overwhelming at once. I finally decided to do some different ggplots including boxplot, density plot, pie chart etc. just to try out how they work.
- I think ggplot functions are not too difficult to implement since they follow similar patterns and all we need to do is to add layers to one another.
- The difficult part for me is to manipulate data using dplyr functions. I sometimes lost track of what I should do next since there are multiple functions to use at once. The piping tool is really useful in this sense.
- I am somewhat confused by type and class. They seem to be very similar concepts. I see that class() is usually more object-oriented while typeof() is from R's point of view.
