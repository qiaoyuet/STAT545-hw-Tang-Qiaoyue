# HW05

## Description

In this homework we explored the levels of factors in a dataset, including the effect of arranging and reordering them. A new package "forcats" is used to achieve reordering of levels. We also investigated writing files and images from R and importing/exporting these files out of R. Color schemes and visualization design are also practised in this homework.

## Describe Process of hw05

- The levels seems to be quite tricky in R since as long as we do no drop the levels, it will still be kept even if there is no observations associated to it. But I found reordering useful especially when creating graphs where I want a decreasing/increasing order.
- Wrting files in and out are very convinient tools.
- In the visualization part I had a trouble using the embedded color scheme of "continent_colors". When I use this it always report that the length are different for aes. I hope to solve this question soon.
- It is very obvious that good visualization provides a lot more information than a "bad" one. And ggplot can indeed do a lot of things. I wish to try them out when doing a real project and facing real demands.
- It seems like that png file can be embedded into the report but the pdf file cannot.
