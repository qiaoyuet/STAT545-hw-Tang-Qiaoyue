## Report process
- Used str_trim to remove white spaces
- Bruce Springsteen page not found
- There are several pages that are broken and R returns an error. But `get_stats_safe` is able to handle it with returning "None available": bruce-springsteen; herb-alperts-tijuana-brass; original-cast-recording; diana-ross-the-supremes; herb-alpert-the-tijuana-brass
- Some of the albums have artist listed as "soundtrack" because the album is from a movie or TV show. Billboard gives the same link for all "soundtrack" artists so it is not informative.
