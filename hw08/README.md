# STAT545-hw08-Tang-Qiaoyue

## Description
I added the following features to the original BC Liquor Store App:
- Add an option to sort the results table by price.
- Add an image of the BC Liquor Store to the UI.
- Use the DT package to turn the current results table into an interactive table.
- Add parameters to the plot.
- The app currently behaves strangely when the user selects filters that return 0 results. For example, try searching for wines from Belgium. There will be an empty plot and empty table generated, and there will be a warning message in the R console. Try to figure out why this warning message is appearing, and how to fix it.
- Place the plot and the table in separate tabs.
