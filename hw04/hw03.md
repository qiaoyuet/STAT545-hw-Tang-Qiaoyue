Part II Merge and Join
----------------------

### Activity \#1

Create a second data frame, complementary to Gapminder. Join this with (part of) Gapminder using a dplyr join function and make some observations about the process and result. Explore the different types of joins.

``` r
country <- c("China","Canada","Argentina","Iraq","Greece","New Zealand","Jamaica","Vatican","Brunei")
languages <- c("Mandarin","English","Spainish","Arabic","Greek","English","English","Italian","Malay")
NATO <- c(0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0) # 1-in NATO, 0-not in NATO
dat_test <- data.frame(country, languages, NATO)

gapminder_editted <- gapminder %>% 
  select(country, lifeExp, gdpPercap) %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarize(mean_gdpPercap = mean(gdpPercap), mean_lifeExp = mean(lifeExp))
```

I created a dataframe with extra two columnsL: the primary language spoken in a country ("languages") and whether they belong to NATO ("NATO"). I also editted the original gapminder dataset so it contains less information. To be convinient, I condensed gpd and life expectancy in all years into mean so that one country only have one line. Vatican and Brunei are two countries that are not in original gapminder for testing.

``` r
left_join(gapminder_editted, dat_test, by="country")
```

Left\_join tends to keep all countries in gapminder\_editted and all the columns in there too, but added the additional columns from dat\_test. Left\_join does not include the two new countries since they do not appear in gapminder\_editted. There are a lot of NAs since there are substancially less countries in dat\_test than in gapminder\_editted.

``` r
right_join(gapminder_editted, dat_test, by="country")
```

Right\_join would keep all the countries in dat\_test and add columns of gapminder\_editted to dat\_test. All information in dat\_test are preserved. NAs appear for mean\_gdp and mean\_lifeExp since gapminder\_editted do not have Vatican and Brunei thus do not have such information. I also observe that doing left\_join but switching the order of datasets would give the same output as doing right\_join. The order of columns are slightly changed but the contents are the same.

``` r
inner_join(gapminder_editted, dat_test, by="country")
```

    ## 7 New Zealand      17262.623     73.98950   English     0

Inner\_join keeps only those countries that occur in both datasets. Therefore, information about Vatican and Brunei are dropped. Other than that, information from both dat\_test and gapminder\_editted are added for those countries appear in both datasets.

``` r
full_join(gapminder_editted, dat_test, by="country")
```

Full\_join keeps every country in both datasets and join all the information together. Vantican and Brunei do not have information about mean\_gdp and mean\_lifeExp so they appear to be NAs; similarly, countries that do not appear in dat\_test but appear in gapminder\_editted miss information about languages and NATO status.

``` r
anti_join(dat_test, gapminder_editted, by="country")
```

    ## Warning: Column `country` joining factors with different levels, coercing
    ## to character vector

    ##   country languages NATO
    ## 1 Vatican   Italian    0
    ## 2  Brunei     Malay    0

Anti\_join only keeps Vatican and Brunei since it filters dat\_test by gapminder\_editted, and the only two countries that are not in gapminder\_editted are Vatican and Brunei. And none of the columns from gapminder\_editted are taken.

``` r
semi_join(dat_test, gapminder_editted, by="country")
```

    ## Warning: Column `country` joining factors with different levels, coercing

    ##       country languages NATO
    ## 1       China  Mandarin    0
    ## 2      Canada   English    1

    ## 4        Iraq    Arabic    0

    ## 6 New Zealand   English    0
    ## 7     Jamaica   English    0

Semi\_join keeps all observations in dat\_test that have a match in gapminder\_editted, so Vantican and Brunei are dropped. Again, none of the columns from gapminder\_editted are taken.
