## Describe Process of hw04

- The main problem I encountered in part I is that I did not get what the question is asking for at first. By talking to my classmates, I understood that we want a row that is seperated by years and columns by countries and the values are life expectancies.
- As mentioned in the .md file as well, I found this very useful tool of displaying multiple ggplots together for easier comparison. The [link](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Multiple_graphs_on_one_page_(ggplot2)/) is here.
- I had a hard time deciding what should I do with the scales in question 1. Initially I wanted to make them have equal scales so that it's easier to compare, but then I tried and saw that there would be some data crowded in one corner because the ranges are so different. I ended up still using a free scale but added more ticks so it's easier to see.
- Part two is easier than part one, and it indeed helps me to be proficient with these join functions through this practise.
